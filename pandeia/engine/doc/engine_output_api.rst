Description of Outputs from an ETC Calculation
==============================================

Exceptions:

  Normally expected exceptions are of base class
    etc3d.custom_exceptions.PyetcException
  The attribute .message contains a plain text description of the problem
  suitable for display to the user.

  There are numerous subclasses of PyetcException that are not documented
  here, but can be seen in etc3d.custom_exceptions


The return value from perform_calcluation() is a dict.  The rest of this document describes the keys in that dict.

error : string
  This string is not reported by the engine, but the name is reserved
  by the server.  See doc/transactions/ws_trans.txt

admin_data : string
  This string is not reported by the engine, but the name is reserved
  by the server.  See doc/transactions/ws_trans.txt

server_test : dict
  This data is not reported by the engine, but the name is reserved
  by the server.  See doc/transactions/ws_trans.txt

transform: dict
  This contains the information that describes the axes in the 2D
  and 3D images (e.g.  sizes, extents, and step sizes). This
  information is used to map pixel coordinates to world coordinates.
  There are two sets of numbers for the wavelength axis because the
  wavelength sampling of the spectrum used in the calculation is
  usually different from the wavelength sampling at the detector
  plane. The detector plane sampling is usually much finer. It would
  be inefficient to perform the ETC calculation at the full detector
  wavelength resolution if that's not required.

  is a list of engine output API format dicts containing with one
  entry per pointing.

warnings: dict
